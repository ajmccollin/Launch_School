When you run this code:

NAME = 'Victor'
print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)

NAME = 'Nina'
print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)

It will print Victor 3 times then change the variable to Nina, then print Nina
    three times, even though it is it supposed to be a constant variable.
